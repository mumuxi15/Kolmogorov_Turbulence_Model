**Objective**

The universe is full of magical things and yet so much to be explored. A lot new discoveries has been made since Galileo Galilei first observed the solar system through a telescope in 1608. Exploring new knowledge with the delight of appreciating universe’s beauty is thrilling and mind-breaking, however, the reality can be often be frustrating. Often times, If you gaze through a telescope, very likely, you will see an unstable blurry image due to a common phenomenon called astronomical seeing. Seeing is caused by the atmospheric air turbulence, as a result of temperature fluctuations and air parcels mix at various densities and temperatures. A light ray is constantly refracted (or bent) when traveling through turbulent air, because refraction occurs when wave travels from one medium to another. In fact, it follows the same principle that causes the “wavy” effect when looking at heat waves on a sun-baked road or from a bonfire.  

The project aims to develop a turbulence model to help in testing and improving the Adaptive Optical systems (AO systems), a system widely used to correct the astronomical seeing problem. The turbulence model follows the well-known Kolmogorov turbulence theory and it was created based on the Perlin noise algorithm. A C-like shading language, OpenGL and Python were used in this project.
