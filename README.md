**Objective**

The project aims to develop a air turbulence simulation model to help in testing and improving the Adaptive Optical systems (AO systems), a widely used system for astrophysicists. The turbulence model follows [Kolmogorov turbulence theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence) and was created based on the 3D gaming technique - Perlin noise algorithm.

**Project Description**

Build moving clouds from mathmatical algorithms 

**System Requirements**

OpenGL (C-like shading language), Python


**How to run**

Download the zipfile, open simplex_update.html, it should run automatically. You can also adjust parameters
